				<p>"Don't be like the rest of them darling." -Coco Channel. Life is too short to wear boring clothes! Regal Attire is a small business that aims at transforming your wardrope in a creative way that helps you stand out. We believe in expressing ourselves through art and creativity because, creativity never goes out of style! Style is saying who you are without having to speak. Ralph Lauren couldn't have said it better - "Style is very personal. It has nothing to do with fashion. Fashion is over quickly. Style is forever." Creativity is contagious and we are just passing it on by transforming your clothes without breaking your budget! This is your one shop solution for all fashion needs.</p>

				<p>I am in love with art and I see art everywhere. We live in a society where art is just a hobby, and completely ignored in most cases. So many people who are exceptionally talented are overshadowed and under appreciated. Artists lack the exposure they need for motivation and this motivated me to try and get my art out there and inspire others in the process. I could put it in an art gallery but how many people do actually take time to walk into an Art Gallery and just appreciate the beauty of it. But think of the number of heads you'd turn by wearing something pretty cool. I also have a love for fashion and I love to stand out and what better way to do so by customizing my own clothes! This would be a great way to look good, express yourself and just be unique. Making you look good whilst doing what I love is just a bonus! -Collyn. A. Muhwati</p>
